      <h3>Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
        This is a heatmap visualization displays the relationship of the top six San Francisco Fire Department neighborhoods (excluding Lincoln Park) that have the 
        worst travel times from December 2018 to February 2019. These times were calculated from the time that firefighters were dispatched to a reported medical incident 
        and the time the firefighters arrived to the scene of the incident. 
        Please see our <a href="data_processing.html">Data/Processing</a> page for more information on the data and processing.
        This visualization maps these times to the day of the month and averages them to condense information and analysis. Additionally, the 
        neighborhoods are sorted by worst averages starting with Treasure Island which has the worst (largest) time averages and the 
        Financial District / South Beach neighborhood which has the least time averages out of the six.

      <h3>Discussion</h3>
      <p>
        From the heatmap alone, we can get an understanding and comparison for what a long travel time is by hovering over the darker shaded areas. We can 
        also see some empty spaces in the Presidio neighborhood. Although this identifies that there is 
        some missing data, we can still get some information from the Presidio neighborhood. Thinking about where the Presidio is, there aren't as much people 
        or structures in the area compared to the rest of San Francisco. Also, the Presidio has a lot more nature and roads that are paved around 
        the trees. From this analysis, we can make a connection as to why the Presidio has one of the worst run times and why it has missing data. 
        Since the Presidio is mostly made of natural fields instead of roads and structures, we might be able to make the correlation that firefighters 
        might have a harder time getting to the scene of these incidents. Since the Presidio has less people in the area, we might also make the 
        connection that the Presidio might receive fewer calls, thus concluding an idea for why there is missing data. 
        After making this analysis on the Presidio, I decided to map out the 
        <a href = "https://sf-fire.org/fire-station-locations">San Francisco Fire Department stations</a> in comparison to these neighborhoods. 
        In the pictures above, I plotted the stations in blue and the neighborhoods in orange. We can see that most of these neighborhoods are 
        on the outskirts of San Francisco. Like the Presidio, Treasure Island seems difficult to handle as there is only one station that 
        takes care of the entire island. With the few other neighborhoods, it seems like there is also a potential for lack of aid from surrounding 
        stations except for the Financial District / South Beach which has the least time averages out of the six neighborhoods.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Overall, it was very interesting to analyze so much data from the San Francisco Fire Department. Although there were some 
        errors in the data, it was very informative and interesting. Three months and one incident type alone had thousands of entries. 
        My main interest though, still lied within these time spans of how long it took to reach the medical incidents because those 
        few minutes could mean life or death.

              <br/>
              My name is Emmit Kamakaniʻoluʻoluʻokoʻolau Kahaʻulelio Parubrub and I am a student at the University of San Francisco 
              majoring in Computer Science. I was born on the island of Oahu, Hawaiʻi and raised in Kahaluʻu. I love being in the ocean, 
              the mountains, or the gym but I have always been fascinated with technology. When I was a child my environment was very 
              rural and filled with nature so when I would see new technology I would be interested and intrigued by how it worked. 
              I am majoring in computer science to foster child-like fascination and passion for technology.
